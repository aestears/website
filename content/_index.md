subtitle: "Plant Population and Community Ecology - Data Science"
description: "I am currently a Postdoctoral researcher at the University of Wyoming as part of the [Weiss-Lehman lab group](https://weisslehmanlab.weebly.com/) and the [Modelscape consortium](https://microcollaborative.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MP/overview). <p> I am an plant ecologist interested in the impact of global change on the ecological processes that shape plant populations and communities. I am particularly excited about creative statistical and computational approaches to answer scientific questions and communicate data and results to managers, conservationists, and the public."
