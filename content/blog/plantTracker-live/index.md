## It's Here!
I'm excited to share that [plantTracker](https://www.astearsresearch.com/package/plantTracker/), an R package that I created as part of my PhD dissertation, is available to download from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=plantTracker)!  

plantTracker provides several user-friendly functions that extract growth, survival, and competition information from repeatedly-sampled, fine-scale maps of organism occurence. We created these functions specifically to get competition and demographic data from repeatedly-mapped quadrats of perennial plants, but are excited for folks to come up with all sorts of creative applications for these functions! 

## Find out more
If you'd like to find out more about the package, you can check out the [paper](https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.13950) we wrote about it, which was published in Methods in Ecology and Evolution in 2022. You can also visit the package [website](https://www.astearsresearch.com/package/plantTracker/) to see vignettes that explain the package and it's main functions. Or, you can skip right to downloading the package by running this code in R: 

``` r
install.packages("plantTracker")
```

Expect more posts with plantTracker tutorials and information in the future!
