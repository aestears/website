intro: I am currently a Postdoctoral scientist at the University of Wyoming as part of both the [Weiss-Lehman lab group](https://weisslehmanlab.weebly.com/) and the [Modelscape consortium](https://microcollaborative.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MP/overview). I'm working on a modeling framework to incorporate interspecific effects into structured population models, and also contribute to collaborative projects that improve our ability to model ecological time series. <p>I recieved my PhD in Ecology from the University of Wyoming in the [Program in Ecology and Evolution](http://uwyo.edu/pie/) and the [Botany Department](http://www.uwyo.edu/botany/), where I worked with Dr. Daniel Laughlin. My doctoral research investigated how environmental variation across space and time drives plant demographic processes, with a specific focus on how plant leaf and root traits mediate the effect of drought on demographic rates in western grass-dominated ecosystems. I also developed an R package to translate maps of plant occurrence into growth, survival, reproduction, and competition data for further analysis. You can find more about my research projects [here](http://astearsresearch.com/research/). <p> Here's my CV {{< embed-pdf url="./AStears_CV_2023_2.pdf" >}}
