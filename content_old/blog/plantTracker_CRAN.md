I'm excited to share that [plantTracker](https://www.astearsresearch.com/package/plantTracker/), an R package that I created as part of my PhD dissertation, is available to download from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=plantTracker)!  

plantTracker provides several user-friendly functions that extract growth, survival, and competition information from repeatedly-sampled, fine-scale maps of organism occurence. We created these functions specifically to get competition and demographic data from repeatedly-mapped quadrats of perennial plants, but are excited for folks to come up with all sorts of creative applications for these functions! 

If you'd like to find out more about the package, you can check out the [paper](https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.13950) we wrote about it, which was published in Methods in Ecology and Evolution in 2022. You can also visit the package [website](https://www.astearsresearch.com/package/plantTracker/) to see vignettes that explain the package and it's main functions. Or, you can skip right to downloading the package by running this code in R: 

``` r
install.packages("plantTracker")
```

Expect more posts about plantTracker tutorials and information in the future!
