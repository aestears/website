Science is, of course, fun, but I also enjoy a lot of other pursuits. I also think it's incredibly important to acknowledge that doing science is a *job*, and even if it is fulfilling and interesting, it's so valuable and necessary to celebrate and prioritize the other elements of our lives as well.  

This page includes links and information about various non-science topics. I hope you find something interesting, useful, or entertaining!
