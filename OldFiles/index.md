I'm a PhD candidate in Ecology at the [University of Wyoming](http://uwyo.edu) in the [Program in Ecology](http://uwyo.edu/pie/) and the [Botany Department](http://www.uwyo.edu/botany/). I am a plant ecologist excited about all sorts of plant and ecological questions, but am particularly interested the impact of global change on ecological processes in plant populations and communities. I use functional traits as tools to understand the mechanisms underlying plant responses to the environment, as well as to make predictions and draw conclusions about plant responses that aren't restricted by taxonomy. 

Here is my [CV](astearsresearch.com/about/CV). 

I grew up in Wyoming and Montana,
